Question Statement:

Implement blocking semaphore using the pause() and kill() system calls (to block and unblock a
process, as demonstrated in my example programs / videos). Now, use your solution to ensure mutually
exclusive access to a shared variable by two cooperating processes. Demonstrate the correctness of your
solution by applying it to solve the race condition problem that I have created in my sample programs
“producer3.c” and “consumer3.c”.
