Question Statement:

1)Create a mini-ls c program to implement well known command 'ls'
☞ it should list the file pointed to by its program first
    argument (argv[1])
☞ compile and run it
☞ now modify it to use stat on each file
☞ get it to add a slash ’/’ to the end of directories
☞ use your imagination to add other status info!
☞ compile and run again
☞ if you have time, try adding a ‘-L’ option
    when the ‘-L’ option is given, your program
    should give the details of symbolic links themselves
    as the ‘-L’ option does for the real

2)Two processes can communicate using shared memory. Similarly they can communicate using a
‘socket’. Socket based interprocess communication is more powerful than shared memory based
communication as it gives you the power to enable communication between two processes
running even on two different physical computers (connected by a LAN/WLAN). 
Now, implement a client-server project where the client and server should communicate
using sockets. Server should provide a computing service which a client / clients can request.
What would be the three service programs?
Ans: as assigned in Assignment-4 to each group (only one computing service is sufficient
for this assignment).
